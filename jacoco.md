# JaCoCo

JaCoCo (Java Code Coverage) is an open-source code coverage library for Java applications. It helps developers measure how much of their codebase is exercised by tests, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of their testing efforts.

## Key Features:

- **Code Coverage Analysis:** JaCoCo tracks which parts of your Java code are executed during testing, offering metrics like line coverage, branch coverage, method coverage, and more. This information helps identify areas of your code that may lack test coverage.

- **Integration with Build Tools:** JaCoCo seamlessly integrates with popular build tools like Maven and Gradle. It can be configured to generate coverage reports during your project's build process.

- **Coverage Reports:** JaCoCo generates comprehensive HTML reports that visualize code coverage metrics. These reports highlight which lines of code were executed by tests and which ones were not, enabling developers to target areas that need better test coverage.

- **Line and Branch Coverage:** JaCoCo provides insights into both line and branch coverage. Line coverage indicates the percentage of executable lines of code that were executed, while branch coverage focuses on the coverage of decision points (if-else statements, switch cases, etc.).

- **Usage with Continuous Integration:** JaCoCo is often used in CI/CD pipelines to monitor and enforce code coverage thresholds. This ensures that new code contributions maintain a certain level of coverage, promoting code quality.

- **Non-Intrusive:** JaCoCo operates as a Java agent and does not require modifications to your source code. It instruments bytecode at runtime, making it a non-intrusive tool for code coverage analysis.

- **Multiple Output Formats:** In addition to HTML reports, JaCoCo supports other output formats such as CSV and XML, allowing flexibility in how coverage data is consumed and integrated into various tools and processes.

By utilizing JaCoCo, developers can gain insights into their code coverage and identify areas where tests need improvement. This promotes better testing practices, enhances code quality, and contributes to the creation of more reliable and maintainable Java applications.
